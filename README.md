# Tic-Tac-Toe-Bot


## Overview

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe bot that interacts with the game board through computer vision. The bot is capable of playing against a human player and making intelligent moves using the minimax algorithm. Additionally, it utilizes an ArUco marker system to enhance the accuracy of object detection.

## Features

- Human vs. Computer Tic Tac Toe gameplay.
- Computer player uses the minimax algorithm for intelligent moves.
- Object detection using computer vision with OpenCV.
- ArUco marker system for camera calibration and accurate positioning.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- pymycobot library (for interacting with the robotic arm)
